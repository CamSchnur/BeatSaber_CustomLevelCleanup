# BeatSaber_CustomLevelCleanup

This is a Windows utililty to help keep your Custom Levels list clean for the game Beat Saber.

I download and play custom levels for the game, and star the ones that I like using the in-game menu, but generally want to delete the others.  There is not an easy way to delete those custom levels in-game, or to know outside of the game what levels you have starred.

This app uses the BeatSaber 'playerdata.dat' and 'songhashdata.dat' files to find which levels in your custom levels folder you have *not* starred, and then deletes them.
